// Placeholder for a customer-sent photo/video that can't be displayed.
//
// These used to render as a bare "[Image]" / "[รูป]" string, which read like a
// glitch — agents reported it as a bug repeatedly, especially on the อัพเซลล์
// ตรวจสอบ page where a submission is often reviewed days after the customer
// sent the proof image. Usually it isn't a glitch at all: LINE's Content API
// only keeps a message's content for about two weeks, and this app only
// started saving its own permanent copy at ingestion time in Sep 2026, so
// every customer image from before that which is now older than LINE's window
// is genuinely gone — nothing to load, no amount of reloading will bring it
// back (see backend/src/lib/imageBackfill.js).
//
// `expired` (the backend answers 410 Gone for exactly this case, as opposed to
// a 5xx it might recover from) is what separates "this is permanently gone,
// stop worrying about it" from "this failed to load, try again" — worth
// keeping distinct, since only one of the two is ever worth reporting.
// Fetches a customer's media through the authenticated proxy, retrying the
// failures that are worth retrying.
//
// Every deploy restarts the server, and requests caught in that window come
// back 502. The components have no retry, so a thumbnail that happened to load
// during a redeploy showed "โหลดรูปไม่ได้" and stayed that way until someone
// reloaded the page — the production log has real examples of agents hitting
// this. The file was never in any danger; the request just arrived at the wrong
// second.
//
// Only transient failures are retried. A 410 means the content is genuinely
// gone from LINE and a 404 means there is nothing to fetch or no access to it —
// repeating either would just be a slower way to show the same placeholder.

// Picks the src for an agent-sent image.

// Prefers this app's OWN relative route over the url stored on the row, which
// is the opposite of what it used to do. metadata.url is absolute and was
// frozen at send time from `${req.protocol}://${req.get('host')}` — whatever
// origin that particular agent happened to be using. Any row whose url got
// baked with a host that no longer resolves from the browser (an http:// one
// that mixed-content blocks, a hostname only reachable from elsewhere, an
// origin the app has since moved off) renders as a broken image with no
// request ever reaching the server — which is exactly why these failures were
// invisible in the deploy logs while agents kept seeing them.
//
// A relative path can't have that problem: it always resolves against the
// origin the page is already being served from. /api/messages/image/:id then
// resolves the file from the row's own imageData column.
//
// Two exceptions fall back to the stored url: an optimistic bubble that hasn't
// been sent yet (its url is a local blob/data one and there's no server row
// to ask for), and a quick-reply message from before sends recorded their own
// imageData — for those the own-route 404s and the caller retries with
// `useStored`.
